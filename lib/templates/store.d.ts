/**
 * Host-side JSON file storage for prompt templates.
 *
 * Location: `~/.dsh/sqs-dsh-better-input/templates.json`. The plugin ships as a flat
 * bundle under node_modules, so anything stored next to the package would be
 * wiped on update — the only durable, dependency-free location is the user's
 * home directory (Node builtins only).
 *
 * Writes are serialized through a promise chain and performed atomically
 * (temp file + rename). A corrupt file is quarantined aside once with a
 * warning instead of failing every subsequent call.
